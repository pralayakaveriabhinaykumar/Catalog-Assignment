# Secret Polynomial Solver

## Description
This project is a Java implementation of a Secret Polynomial Solver. It uses Lagrange interpolation to find the secret constant term (c) of a polynomial based on given points in a JSON file.

## Features
- Parse points from a JSON file.
- Perform Lagrange interpolation to find the polynomial.
- Calculate the secret constant term of the polynomial.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- A JSON file containing the points (e.g., `test_cases.json`)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SecretPolynomialSolver.git
   cd SecretPolynomialSolver
